This Haskell script turns a [get_iplayer](http://squarepenguin.co.uk/) download history file into a podcast feed.

There are other tools that do the same or similar things, such as (Martin O'Hanlon's get_iplayer_genrss)[https://github.com/martinohanlon/get_iplayer_genrss], but this one is mine and it's what I use.
